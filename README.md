## How the game works?

The game requires deposit an amount of money to work with. After that the game automatically and randomly rolls 2 dice. If sum of both dice equal to 7, the player wins $4 otherwise the player loses $1.
The game can detect the amount of money has been won or has been lost, so if the player wins more money than the amount deposited, the game gives prompt to continue or leave the game and collect the money that the player won. If the player wants to continue the game after winning more money than the deposit amount, the game will continue rolls the dice until the player wins another match and winning more money than the deposit amount.
At the end of the game the game will shows a summary about the player's game. and the player can start a new game without quitting the game.
